      Then the wode spake, saying, &ldquo;The two and twenty most eldern seals live on today in their offspring, the eight and twenty youngern seals. The eldern are made up of five seals in seven offsprung shifting seals, socalled because they shift; and seventeen seals in one and twenty offsprung standing seals, socalled because they stand. Herein we betell the wonderful and oldtokenish two and twenty, beginning with the five who began to shift.
      </p>
      <p>
      &ldquo;The glowing <strong>Handseal</strong>, eleventh of name and first of shift, gives all the good and evil in this world. It was begotten by the freezing, freezing ice, and it so now hallows it. But icicles backstabbed the glowing Handseal, and two deals of it were taken away.
      </p>
      <p>
      &ldquo;So the two shapes molted, and became the glowing <strong>Hookseal</strong>, next of name and next of shift. It gives bliss, thrill, and begriplock. The left shape hallows the urox, and the right shape hallows the yoke.
      </p>
      <p>
      &ldquo;And the left shape molted, and became the glowing <strong>Welkinseal</strong>, nineteenth of name and fifth of shift. It gives meekness and hallows the horse. And the right shape molted also, and became the glowing <strong>Eyeseal</strong>, fifteenth of name and sixth of shift. It gives insight and hallows the oak. And in good sooth the glowing Welkinseal and the glowing Eyeseal loved each other, and they were gripped with bliss.
      </p>
      <p>
      &ldquo;And the two seals molted together, and became the glowing <strong>Oxseal</strong>, fourth of name and last of shift. They give steadfastness, drawn together by an everlasting bond. And so the glowing Oxseal do hallow the ash. Hence these are the seven shifting seals that were born from the five who began to shift, and altogether they are a sevenfold star in twos.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
      Then the wode breathed deeply and spake again, saying, &ldquo;Of the one and twenty standing seals offsprung from the latter seventeen seals, there are three sundry strings that arise wonesomely.
      </p>
      <p>
      &ldquo;The seven hanging beads of the <strong>third and lowest string</strong> are: the boughseal, the folmseal, the boughseal again, the tungseal, the markseal, the wombseal, and the endseal. To these are hallowed the cen, the kaun, the gift, the pear, Tue herself, the birch, and the day.
      </p>
      <p>
      &ldquo;The seven hanging beads of the <strong>next and middle string</strong> are: the hookseal, the hookseal again, the ringseal, the blockseal, the fishseal, the boneseal, and the bladeseal. To these are hallowed the fee, the bull, the thurse, the hail, the yew, the sun, and the elk.
      </p>
      <p>
      &ldquo;The seven hanging beads of the <strong>first and highest string</strong> are: the helmseal, the hookseal, the snakeseal, the handseal, the flailseal, the waterseal, and the spearseal. To these are hallowed the ride, the wen, the need, the year, the lake, the man, and the cwerth.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
      Then the wode breathed even deeper and spake yet again, saying, &ldquo;And so the hook begat the fee and the urox and the bull and the wen and the yoke, and the ring begat the thurse, and the eye begat the oak, and the helm begat the ride, and the bough and palm together begat the cen and the kaun, and the bough alone begat the gift, and the block begat the hail, and the snake begat the need, and the hand begat the ice and the year, and the fish begat the yew, and the tung begat the pear, and the blade begat the elk, and the mark begat Tue herself, and the womb begat the birch, and the welkin begat the horse, and the water begat the man, and the flail begat the lake, and the end begat the day, and the ox begat the ash, and it was fulfilled.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
      When she had said all of this in full, the outcasts (that is, those followers of <a href = "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hassan-i_Sabbah">Hason Percyton</a>) were amazed, for she was then nowhere to be found. And it happened that <em>all</em> of the thieves had gathered in the cave; and frightening Hex sat upon the rock, and the witches <em>did</em> gather about frightening Hex, and the wrights <em>were</em> likewise gathered about frightening Hex.
