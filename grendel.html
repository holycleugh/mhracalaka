For I cannot believe, that in the language of the Brahmans, when it was a vernacular tongue, the ak&amacr;ra had always the power of a short a, and that the sounds of e and o never occurred in it; I rather think that the sign used for the short a, was put also to express a short e and o. If this was the case, it can be accounted for why in words common to the Sanskrit and Greek, the Indian ak&amacr;ra so often answers to &epsilon; and &omicron;, as for instance, asti, he is, &#x1f11;&sigma;&tau;&iota;&#x0301;; patis, husband, &pi;&omicron;&#x0301;&sigma;&iota;&sigmaf;; ambaras, sky, &#x1f41;&#x0301;&mu;&beta;&rho;&omicron;&sigmaf;, rain, &amp;c.&rdquo;</em>

      <p>
      The seven motes of malm, they are ironmalm, oremalm, ercmalm, tinmalm, goldmalm, quickmalm, leadmalm. And the seven motes of dust, they are glazedust, coaldust, flintdust, waxdust, brimdust, atterdust, stinkdust. So, there are three kinds of stuff, and they are the the malm, the root, the dust. Each kind of stuff works a wending of its <em>thing</em>. The root wends <em>only</em>, whilst the malm and the dust wend <em>otherly</em>. And lastly, each mote of malm matches a <em>onesome</em> mote of dust. So, here are the matches.
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Quickmalm matches brimdust (suchness of one).</li>
        <li>Oremalm   matches stinkdust.</li>
        <li>Ironmalm  matches coaldust.</li>
        <li>Tinmalm   matches glazedust.</li>
        <li>Leadmalm  matches flintdust.</li>
        <li>Ercmalm   matches atterdust.</li>
        <li>Goldmalm  matches waxdust.</li>
