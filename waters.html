      To <em>Churchswater</em> there is an inexplicable essence, a light-bearing essence. A plastic molded perhaps from light itself, and penetrated indeed by even the meekest eyes. It exudes clarity, and it exudes purity, and it exudes a sparkling richness unfound elsewhere.
      </p>
      <p>
      To <em>Pilgrimswater</em> there is a thicker essence, of the earth. Even a fool can see this, for the substance incubates inside the earth, gathering all of its minerals. Its wortish colour, though see-through at the surface, is unmistakeable by one who has tasted already Churchswater.
      </p>
      <p>
      To <em>Mortarswater</em>, now, the essence is much more difficult to characterise. Though alike in formful form to Pilgrimswater, the similarities end here. Lo, if it looks like a duck, swims like a duck, and quacks like a duck, then mirad, it is no less than duckful in function. Mortarswater is see-through, like Churchswater. And Mortarswater shines brightly in flavour, as does Churchswater. And Mortarswaters 精狐精輝 shines so brightly that it is untouchable until it has by the winds of this earth been tamed.

      To <em>Smartwater</em> the essence is sister to the essence of Churchswater, with one difference: Smartwater is very bulky! In this respect Smartwater <em>does</em> exceed Churchswater. Furthermore, for reasons perhaps again sister to those of Churchswater, it is emitted from Smartwater a radiance ten thousand times greater than the radiance of Mortarswater.

      To <em>Roodswater</em> there is nothing to be said.
      </p>
      <p>
      To <em>Dasaniswater</em> a quick mention must be given, for its essence is that of everlastinghood, inextinguishability, forgiveness, deathlessness, immortality, and limiting edict. At every fixed spring there is a well of Dasaniswater, and at every earthly spring there are founts even more. And with radiance as its purpose, has never Dasaniswater failed to shine in this present world.

      I give now final notes to the following otherworldly substances, which may be found only without this world. To <em>Garhardstonerswater</em>, the stone cries out in joy. To <em>Strongholdswater</em>, what. And to <em>Urnswater</em>, to-morrow awaits.
