      <p>
      Andalib, Andalib. Tell me the suchness of the loudmote, and tell me the name of its yoke and flock. Tell me of its beaming shade, and tell me of its glowing shape. Tell me where the blocksome and the edgesome grow their splitting fields.
			</p>
			<p>
			This world is very loud, and this world has many louds. To understand the loud, is to yoke its mote into its flock. Indeed, the minding loudbit loudmesh of loudness stretches lainwise by its kind of berth and stoodwise by its kind of way. <strong><em>Look!</em></strong>
			</p>
			<p>
			<strong>The glowing <span class = "glow">kinds of berth</span><sup>1</sup> are eight&mdash;</strong><br />
			The lippy liploud, the toothy toothloud, the cuppy cuploud, the roofy roofloud,<br />
			The thatchy thatchloud<sup>2</sup>, the leeky leekloud, the wardy wardloud<sup>3</sup>, the throaty throatloud.
			</p>
			<p>
			<strong>The glowing <span class = "glow">kinds of way</span> are eight&mdash;</strong><br />
			The blasting blaster, the fizzing fizzer, the nosing noser, the tapping tapper,<br />
			The leaning leaner, the gliding glider, the pushing pusher, the clicking clicker.
			</p>
			<p>
			The glide of the highest lift, the glide is the loud that glows without bond.<br />
			</p>
			<p>
			The lean of the higher lift, the lean is the loud that frontwise chokes, that bothwise glows.<br />
      The nose of the higher lift, the nose is the loud that herewise chokes, that upwise glows.
			</p>
			<p>
			The tap of the lift<sup>4</sup>, the tap is the loud that chokes, that glows.<br />
			The fizz of the lift, the fizz is the loud that almost chokes, that barely glows.<br />
			</p>
			<p>
			The blast of the land, the blast is the loud that chokes in bond.<br />
			The push<sup>5</sup> of the land, the blast is the loud that chokes in bond.<br />
			The click of the land, the blast is the loud that chokes in bond. <strong><em>Look!</em></strong>
			</p>
			<p>
			At once <ins><em>the word (the maniwort (the root (THE HEART THE REAR) THE HEAD))</em></ins>!
			</p>
			<p>
			The loud is the faying of berth and way, <span class = "reap">The mote is the faying of axled mark,</span><br />
			To know the loud is to know the tung, <span class = "reap">To know the mote is to understand,</span><br />
 	 	 	Eightwise outright drawing one. <span class = "reap">Eightwise upright eking three.</span><br />
			
			</p>
			<p>
			The mote is the block, the mote is the edge,<br />
			The mote is smooth and the mote is staved,<br />
			&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The mote is sheer, or nosed, or leant,<br />
			<span class = "reap">The mote lies down and the mote is seven.</span><br />
			The mote is the fore, the mote is the blade,<br />
			&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The mote is ringed, or tipped, or raised,<br />
			The mote is the hilt and the mote is the root,<br />
			&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The mote is nearfar, or liftland, or tightlax, or almonds,<br />
			<span class = "reap">The mote stands up and the mote is eleven.</span><br />
			</p>
			<p>
			The louds tell eight by eight<sup>6</sup>, but the motes tell seven and seventy<sup>7</sup>.<br />
			Then thirteen hidden and unspeaksome loudmotes linger outside this world.<br />
			Are they kind&mdash; or are they cind<sup>8</sup>?
