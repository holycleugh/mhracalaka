        The sun is yoked to heavens shooting star,<br />
        So stand she must before her massive fate.<br />
        When they approach, their glowing bonds create<br />
        A beam ablaze that pierces ever far.
        </p>
        <p>
        So shall the sun avert her gaze ajar<br />
        Until her cataclysm doth abate;<br />
        Or shall some chasm bend their bond too straight<br />
        And haply quell the brilliance of her char;
        </p>
        <p>
        Neither! look, the star is doubly-bound:<br />
        Her path towards the sun is rein&egrave;d by<br />
        Some distant seasons steady ebb and flow.
        </p>
        <p>
        Her shining threads may never be unwound<br />
        As times advance is made to nullify.<br />
        So pass the twain, and wends their rigid glow.

        Cardinal, cardinal, burned with the brand called<br />
        Cardinal, blazing, thou beckonst the bosk to<br />
        Bond and combust with thee, bond and grow brighter&mdash;<br/>
        Brighter! and boundless, her brilliance imbib&egrave;d.
        </p>
        <p>
        Showered in rainfall and quietly perching,<br />
        Ordinal, ordinal, ne&rsquo;er to do mischief,<br />
        Leadeth thy kindred, the juvenile into<br />
        Helical gardens that fillen in excess.<br />
