      It is finished. For it is written, &ldquo;And seeing the multitudes, he went up into a mountain&rdquo;.
      </p>
      <p>
      Woe to you, for it is written, &ldquo;Lord, even the devils are subject unto us through thy name&rdquo;.
      </p>
      <p>
      Put up again thy sword into his place.
      </p>
      <p>
      <em>Eli, Eli, lama sabachthani?</em> that is to say, My God, my God, why hast thou forsaken me?
      </p>
      <p>
      Thou hast heard that it was said, &ldquo;Ye are the light of the world&rdquo;;
      </p>
      <p>
      For it is written, &ldquo;And he shall send his angels with a great sound of a trumpet, and they shall gather together his elect from the four winds, from one end of heaven to the other&rdquo;;
      </p>
      <p>
      And it is written, &ldquo;And whosoever shall exalt himself shall be humbled; and he that shall humble himself shall be exalted&rdquo;.
      </p>
      <p>
      But behold, it is written, &ldquo;&lsquo;the sun will be darkened, and the moon will not give its light&rsquo;&rdquo;.
      </p>
      <p>
      And behold, it is written, &ldquo;Thy brother is come; and thy father has killed the fatted calf, because he hath received him safe and sound&rdquo;;
      </p>
      <p>
      And it is written, &ldquo;for this thy brother was dead, and is alive again; and was lost, and is found&rdquo;.
