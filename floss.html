      <h3>Flossing patterns.</h3>
      <p>
      On 2 July 2017, I began to use a 200-yard spool of <span class = "ct">dental floss</span>. I used it nightly until 7 April 2018, when I came down to the final 0.5 inches. I have organised below some statistics for my viewing pleasure.
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Days flossed: 280 days</li>
        <li>Average daily string use: 25.714 inches</li>
        <li>Cost of floss per day*: $0.014</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
      Then we can conclude that I have made my use of <span class = "ct">dental floss</span> more economical.

      On 17 November 2016, I purchased a 200-metre spool of <span class = "ct">dental floss</span> for $3.92 (before sales tax). I used it nightly until 1 July 2017, when I came down to the final 6.5 inches. I have organised below some statistics for my viewing pleasure.
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Cost of floss per day<sup>&dagger;</sup>: $0.0173</li>
        <li>Length of floss prescribed by dentist: 45.72 cm (18.00 in)</li>
        <li>Days flossed, with the 6.5-inch outlier: 226</li>
        <li>Average length of floss per day: 88.50 cm (34.84 in)</li>
        <li>Days flossed, without the 6.5-inch outlier: 225</li>
        <li>Average length of floss per day: 88.82 cm (34.97 in)</li>
      </ul>

      <span style = "font-size: 0.75em;">*Mirad, I have made the assumption that the cost of floss is constant across time.</span><br />
      <span style = "font-size: 0.75em;"><sup>&dagger;</sup>Mirad, I have assumed no sales tax and a flat cost per day independent of string length.</span>
