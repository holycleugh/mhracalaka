    <main>
      <p>
      The workmaking of the reckontellsframe, being groundly to all other tellframes (such as the wholetells, the breaktells, the filltells, and the twintells), must be fulfilled with gladdening thoroughness. Farbeit that we forthgo on some muddied binding of unshapely bemarkings, this wondrous undertaking of ours shall begin with the following rooted bemarkings.
      </p>
      <p>
      <strong>Bemarking.</strong> A <strong>many</strong> is a gathering of things, betokened by any lesserstaff.
      </p>
      <p>
      <strong>Bemarking.</strong> A <strong>fullmany</strong> is a gathering of things too great to be inheld by a many; and is betokened by any greaterstaff. Every many is a fullmany, but some fullmanies are not manies.
      </p>
      <p>
      <strong>Bemarking.</strong> For a thing to be <strong>inheld</strong> in a fullmany is for it to be in that fullmany; and is betokened by the seal $\in$. Manies are inheld by both manies and fullmanies; however, fullmanies are heavenly, and cannot be inheld.
      </p>
      <p>
      <strong>Bemarking.</strong> For two manies to be the <strong>same</strong>, or else to have <strong>sameness</strong>, is for them to inhold rightly the same things; and is betokened by the seal $=$.
      </p>
      <p>
      We deem knowledge of the tung of shapely thinklore, namely the shapely links of doomset, leadset, foldset, ekeset, evenset, allpickset, and onepickset. Nevertheless, a bemarking of each of these things is given.
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>That the <strong>moteset</strong> &ldquo;$\phi$&rdquo; is true means: $\phi$ is true.</li>
        <li>That the <strong>doomset</strong> &ldquo;$\neg\phi$&rdquo; is true means: $\phi$ is lease.</li>
        <li>That the <strong>leadset</strong> &ldquo;$\phi \implies \psi$&rdquo; is true means: $\phi$ is lease <strong>or</strong> $\psi$ is true.</li>
        <li>That the <strong>foldset</strong> &ldquo;$\phi \land \psi$&rdquo; is true means: $\phi$ is true <strong>and</strong> $\psi$ is true.</li>
        <li>That the <strong>ekeset</strong> &ldquo;$\phi \lor \psi$&rdquo; is true means: $\phi$ is true <strong>or</strong> $\psi$ is true.</li>
        <li>That the <strong>evenset</strong> &ldquo;$\phi \iff \psi$&rdquo; is true means: $\phi$ and $\psi$ are both true <strong>or</strong> $\phi$ and $\psi$ are both lease.</li>
        <li>That the <strong>allpickset</strong> &ldquo;$\forall x\phi x$&rdquo; is true means: <strong>every</strong> $x$ gladdens $\phi x$.</li>
        <li>That the <strong>onepickset</strong> &ldquo;$\exists x\phi x$&rdquo; is true means: <strong>some</strong> $x$ gladdens $\phi x$.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
      Mind that the moteset is not a shapely link. Of the others, we take doomset, leadset, and allpickset as rooted, and take the lingering three as stemming. To this we limben the manylorish links of undermany and overmany, which have their wonesome bemarkings.
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>That the <strong>undermanyset</strong> &ldquo;$F \subseteq G$&rdquo; is true means: every thing in $F$ is inheld by $G$.</li>
        <li>That the <strong>overmanyset</strong> &ldquo;$F \supseteq G$&rdquo; is true means: every thing in $G$ is inheld by $F$.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
      Next, the <strong>unmany</strong>, betokened $\O$, is the fullmany which inholds no thing. Though a stemming bemarking, the upbringing of the unmany here shall greatly easen the forthing of our foresets in the next leaf.
      </p>
      <p>
      Lastly, we brook the betokening $(m, n)$ to bemark the fullmany $\{m, \{m, n\}\}$. Such a fullmany is called the <strong>ranked twain</strong> of $m$ and $n$, which is findsome for every $m$ and $n$.
      </p>
      <p>
      Having fulfilled this, we are ready to begin the reckontellish workmake.
      </p>
      <hr />
      <p>
      The reckontellsframe can be gladdeningly workmade with no more than six foresets: those of shapeness, fayness, mightiness, ingroundness, unendness, and waleness. Of these, shapeness upbrings the thought of mapping; fayness and mightiness workmake key manyworkings; and ingroundness, unendness, and waleness let us handle nought and unending with much bendsomeness. We give a shapely forth of each foreset before outlining their sheer and overwhelming strength.
      </p>
      <p>
      <strong>Foreset of shapeness (S).</strong> If $F$ is a fullmany and $W$ is a mapping, then the <strong>lift</strong> of $W$ from $F$, betokened $W(F)$, is the onesome fullmany of every thing in $F$ mapped by $W$; or, $$\forall W\forall F\exists G\forall n(n \in G \iff \exists m(m \in F \land (m, n) \in W)) \text{.}$$
      </p>
      <p>
      <strong>Foreset of fayness (F).</strong> If $F$ is a fullmany, then the <strong>faying</strong> of $F$, betokened $\bigcup F$, is the onesome fullmany of every thing inheld by some thing in $F$; or, $$\forall F\exists Y\forall m(\exists n(m \in n \land n \in F) \iff m \in Y) \text{.}$$
      </p>
      <p>
      <strong>Foreset of mightiness (M).</strong> If $F$ is a fullmany, then the <strong>might</strong> of $F$, betokened $2^F$, is the onesome fullmany of every fullmany under $F$; or, $$\forall F\exists M\forall m(m \subseteq F \iff m \in M) \text{.}$$
      </p>
      <p>
      <strong>Foreset of ingroundness (G).</strong> If $F$ is an unempty fullmany, then some thing in $F$ gladdens that it inholds no thing inheld by $F$; or, $$\forall F(F \neq \O \implies \exists m(m \in F \land \forall n(n \in m \land n \notin F))) \text{.}$$
      </p>
      <p>
      <strong>Foreset of unendness (U).</strong> Some fullmany $U$ gladdens that: it inholds the unmany, and if the onething of a onemany is in $U$, then the onemany is in $U$; or, $$\exists U(\O \in U \land \forall m(m \in U \implies (m \cup \{ m \}) \in U)) \text{.}$$
      </p>
      <p>
      <strong>Foreset of waleness (W).</strong> Some mapping $W$ gladdens that: it inholds a ranked twain of every unempty many and some thing in the many; or, $$\exists W\forall m(m \neq \O \implies \exists n(n \in m \land (m, n) \in W)) \text{.}$$
      </p>
      <p>
      We now begin the workmake, in a way that shall brighten the sakes and dreams of our picking of foresets.
      </p>
      <p>
      We first beseech <strong>(U)</strong> to workmake its namesake fullmany $U$. <strong>(S)</strong> next lets us workmake the unmany as a standalone many by means of the setting $\O = \{ m \in U \mid \forall n(n \in m \implies n \neq n) \}$. Having indeed found the unmany to inhold no thing, we bemark $1 = \{ m \in U \mid \forall n(n \in m \implies n = \O) \} = \{ 0 \}$. Likewise, $2 = \{ m \in U \mid \forall n(n \in m \implies (n = \O \lor n = 1)) \} = \{ 0, 1 \}$. This working can be agained to enough gladdening. The findsomeness of these manies follows from the bemarking of $U$ itself: as $U$ inholds $\O$, it also inholds $1 = \{ \O \}$, and so inholds $2 = \{ \O, \{ \O \} \}$, and so inholds $3 = \{ \O, \{ \O \}, \{ \O, \{ \O \} \} \}$, and so on. When telling or reckoning the reckontells, the whole many $U$ is betokened $\aleph_0$ or $\omega$, fulfillingly. Mind that &ldquo;$\O$&rdquo; shows up once in $0$, and thereafter $2^{t - 1}$ times in each $t$. So it follows that the number of times, that $\aleph_0$ lists $\O$, is given by $2^{\aleph_0 - 1} = 2^{\aleph_0} = |\F| = \aleph_1$.
      </p>
      <p>
      Much of our daily speech is a wittily stealthed forthput of this kind: as byword, when we say &ldquo;My sister and I together have seven cats&rdquo;, we are saying &ldquo;Some twinmapping goes between the many of our cats and the many \[ 7 = \{ \O, \{ \O \}, \{ \O, \{ \O \} \}, \{ \O, \{ \O \}, \{ \O, \{ \O \} \} \}, \{ \O, \{ \O \}, \{ \O, \{ \O \} \}, \{ \O, \{ \O \}, \{ \O, \{ \O \} \} \} \}, \{ \O, \{ \O \}, \{ \O, \{ \O \} \}, \{ \O, \{ \O \}, \{ \O, \{ \O \} \} \}, \{ \O, \{ \O \}, \{ \O, \{ \O \} \}, \{ \O, \{ \O \}, \{ \O, \{ \O \} \} \} \} \}, \{ \O, \{ \O \}, \{ \O, \{ \O \} \}, \{ \O, \{ \O \}, \{ \O, \{ \O \} \} \}, \{ \O, \{ \O \}, \{ \O, \{ \O \} \}, \{ \O, \{ \O \}, \{ \O, \{ \O \} \} \} \}, \{ \O, \{ \O \}, \{ \O, \{ \O \} \}, \{ \O, \{ \O \}, \{ \O, \{ \O \} \} \}, \{ \O, \{ \O \}, \{ \O, \{ \O \} \}, \{ \O, \{ \O \}, \{ \O, \{ \O \} \} \} \} \} \} \} \text{&rdquo;,} \] but shortened for ease of speech. From here the wonesome workings of eking, drawing, folding, and cleaving can be bemarked. Now mind the alikeness of $t + 0 = t$ to $t \cup 0 = t$, and of $t \cdot 1 = t$ to $t \cap \aleph_0 = t$ and $t \cap \omega = t$. Hence the reckontellsframe of the world and all that is so, is twofoldedly threshed between nothing and everything, and so <span id = "hyt-ys-geendod">Hyt ys geendod</span>.
