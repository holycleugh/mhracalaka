      <h3>Join of arrogance and humility.</h3>
      <p>
      Whereas it is known to us that the Jedi and the Sith <em>do</em> possess supernatural communication with <span class = "ct">all the knowledege in the world</span>.
      </p>
      <p>
      It is clear to me now that I must begin with the presentation of the facts.
      </p>
      <div>From the third &mdash; first, Jedi foreknowledge (阳).<br />
      <pre>
  <ins>ANAKIN</ins>  : I sense Count Dooku.<br />
  <ins>OBI-WAN</ins> : I sense a trap.<br />
  <ins>ANAKIN</ins>  : Next move?<br />
  <ins>OBI-WAN</ins> : Spring the trap.
      </pre>
      <p>
      (i) Then behold, we have established that Jedi foreknowledge extends to <span class = "ct">clairvoyance of what is to come</span>.
      </p>
      <pre>
  <ins>GRIEVOUS</ins>: Whats the situation, captain?<br />
  <ins>LUSHROS</ins> : Two Jedi have landed in the main hangar-bay. Were tracking<br /><br />            them.<br />
  <ins>GRIEVOUS</ins>: Just as Count Dooku predicted!<br />
    <em><ins>GRIEVOUS</ins></em> does <em>cough. Afterwards, <ins>GRIEVOUS</ins></em> does <em>laugh.</em>
      </pre>
      <p>
      (ii) Then behold, we have established that Jedi foreknowledge extends to <span class = "ct">clairvoyance of what is to come</span>.
      </p>
      <pre>
  <ins>YODA</ins>    : Careful you must be when sensing the future, Anakin. The fear<br /><br />            of loss is a path to the dark side.
      </pre>
      <p>
      (iii) Then behold, we have established that Jedi foreknowledge extends to <span class = "ct">clairvoyance of what is to come</span>.
      </p>
     <pre>
  <ins>OBI-WAN</ins> : Not even the younglings survived.<br />
  <ins>YODA</ins>    : Killed not by clones, this padawan. By a lightsabre, he was.<br />
  <ins>OBI-WAN</ins> : Who? Who could have done this?<br />
    <em><ins>YODA</ins></em> does <em>groan.</em>
      </pre>
      <p>
      (iv) Then behold, we have established that Jedi foreknowledge extends to <span class = "ct">remembrance of things past</span>.
      </p>
      <pre>
  <ins>OBI-WAN</ins> : Wait, master. There is something I must know.<br />
  <ins>YODA</ins>    : If into the security recordings you go, only pain will you find.<br />
  <ins>OBI-WAN</ins> : I must know the truth, master.
      </pre>
      <p>
      (v) Then behold, we have established that Jedi foreknowledge extends to <span class = "ct">remembrance of things past</span>.
      </p>
      <pre>
  <ins>SIDIOUS</ins> : Lord Vader, can you hear me?<br />
  <ins>VADER</ins>   : Yes, master. Where is Padm&eacute;? Is she safe? Is she alright?<br />
  <ins>SIDIOUS</ins> : It seems, in your anger, you killed her.<br />
  <ins>VADER</ins>   : I? I couldnt have. She was alive &mdash; I felt it!
      </pre>
      <p>
      (vi) Then behold, we have established that Jedi foreknowledge extends to <span class = "ct">understanding of every current existence</span>.
      </p>
      </div>
      <hr />
      <div>And again, from the third &mdash; Jedi forefeeling (阴).
      <pre>
  <ins>DOOKU</ins>   : I sense great fear in you, Skywalker. You have hate. You have<br /><br />            anger. But you dont use them.
      </pre>
      <p>
      (vii) Then behold, we have established that Jedi forefeeling extends to <span class = "ct">furious anger</span>.
      </p>
      <pre>
  <ins>OBI-WAN</ins> : Anakin, our allegiance is to the Senate, not to its leader,<br /><br />            who has managed to stay in office long after his term has expired.<br />
  <ins>ANAKIN</ins>  : The Senate demanded that he stay longer.<br />
  <ins>OBI-WAN</ins> : Yes, but use your feelings, Anakin. Something is out of place.
      </pre>
      <p>
      (viii) Then behold, we have established that Jedi forefeeling extends to <span class = "ct">lukewarm discomfort</span>.
      </p>
      <pre>
  <ins>FRANK</ins>   : You must sense what I have come to suspect. The Jedi Council<br /><br />            want control of the Republic. Theyre planning to betray me.<br />
  <ins>ANAKIN</ins>  : I dont think that &mdash;<br />
  <ins>FRANK</ins>   : Anakin... search your feelings. You know, dont you?<br />
  <ins>ANAKIN</ins>  : I know they dont trust you.
      </pre>
      <p>
      (ix) Then behold, we have established that Jedi forefeeling extends to <span class = "ct">lukewarm discomfort</span>.
      </p>
      <pre>
  <ins>FRANK</ins>   : Are you going to kill me?<br />
  <ins>ANAKIN</ins>  : I would certainly like to.<br />
  <ins>FRANK</ins>   : I know you would. I can feel your anger. It gives you focus.<br /><br />            Makes you stronger.
      </pre>
      <p>
      (x) Then behold, we have established that Jedi forefeeling extends to <span class = "ct">furious anger</span>.
      </p>
      <pre>
  <ins>WINDU</ins>   : I sense a plot to destroy the Jedi. The dark side of the Force<br /><br />            surrounds the Chancellor.
      </pre>
      <p>
      (xi) Then behold, we have established that Jedi forefeeling extends to <span class = "ct">lukewarm discomfort</span>.
      </p>
      <pre>
  <ins>SIDIOUS</ins> : The Force is strong with you! A powerful Sith you will become.<br /><br />            Henceforth, you shall be known as Darth Vader.
      </pre>
      <p>
      (xii) Then behold, we have established that Jedi forefeeling extends to <span class = "ct">furious anger</span>.
      </p>
       <pre>
    <em><ins>YODA</ins></em> does <em>groan.</em>
      </pre>
      <p>
      (xiii) Then behold, we have established that Jedi forefeeling extends to <span class = "ct">a myriad wails of sorrow</span>.
      </p>
      <pre>
    <em><ins>YODA</ins></em> does <em>drop his cane, clutch his heart, and collapse.</em>
      </pre>
      <p>
      (xiv) Then behold, we have established that Jedi forefeeling extends to <span class = "ct">a myriad wails of sorrow</span>.
      </p>
      <pre>
  <ins>OBI-WAN</ins> : I do not know where the Emperor has sent [Anakin].<br /><br />            I dont know where to look.<br />
  <ins>YODA</ins>    : Use your feelings, Obi-Wan, and find him, you will.
      </pre>
      <p>
      (xv) Then behold, we have established that Jedi forefeeling extends to <span class = "ct">lukewarm discomfort</span>.

      We use these <em>ma&#7749;h&amacr;t&amacr;ga&ntilde;</em>:

      Now, we derive these <em>surat&amacr;ga&ntilde;</em>:

      And we use the semantics of Jaakko Hintikka. With these tools we shall prove <span class = "ct">all the knowledge in the world</span>.
