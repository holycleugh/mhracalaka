      From <strong><em>Monariste</em></strong>s thaumatious bibliotheca.<br />
      The sixth day of the monologue of Syntaxis unto Genopotia,<br />
      As seen by Pherenike the telescope and spoken unto Thelorectra the typhlous.
      </p>
      <p>
      <em>Start of the second hour.</em>
      </p>
      <p>
      <strong>Pherenike.</strong> These are the words that <strong><em>Porphyre</em></strong> spoke to the despairing Argyre, whose eyes were burning with tears of pity and confusion.
      </p>
      <p>
      <strong>Porphyre.</strong> This despair and weakness in a time of crisis are mean and unworthy of you, Argyre. How have you fallen into a state so far from the path to liberation? It does not become you to yield to this weakness. Arise with a brave heart and destroy the enemy.
      </p>
      <p>
      <strong>Argyre.</strong> How can I ever bring myself to fight against Megadeime and Dendra, who are worthy of reverence? How can I, Porphyre? Surely it would be better to spend my life begging than to kill these great and worthy souls! If I killed them, every pleasure I found would be tainted. I don&rsquo;t even know which would be better, for us to conquer them or for them to conquer us. The children of Thelorectra have confronted us; but why would we care to live if we killed them?
      </p>
      <p>My will is paralysed, and I am utterly confused. Tell me which is the better path for me. Let me be your disciple. I have fallen at your feet; give me instruction. What can overcome a sorrow that saps all my vitality? Even power over people and gods or the wealth of an empire seem empty.
      </p>
      <p>
      <strong>Pherenike.</strong> This is how Argyre, the great warrior, spoke to <strong><em>Porphyre</em></strong>. With the words, &ldquo;O Porphyre, I will not fight,&rdquo; she fell silent. As they stood between the two armies, <strong><em>Porphyre</em></strong> smiled and replied to Argyre, who had sunk into despair.
      </p>
      <p>
      <strong>Porphyre.</strong> You speak sincerely, but your sorrow has no cause. The wise grieve neither for the living nor for the dead. There has never been a time when you and I and the basils gathered here have not existed, nor will there be a time when we will cease to exist.
      </p>
      <p>
      &vellip;
      </p>
      <p>
      Just as a reservoir is of little use when the whole countryside is flooded, scriptures are of little use to the illumined one, who sees the <em>apeiron</em> everywhere.
      </p>
      <p>
      &vellip;
      </p>
      <p>
      <strong>Argyre.</strong> Tell me of those who live established in wisdom, ever aware of the <em>ego</em>, o Porphyre. How do they talk? How sit? How move about?
      </p>
      <p>
      &vellip;
      </p>
      <p>
      <strong>Porphyre.</strong> As rivers flow into the ocean but cannot make the vast ocean overflow, so flow the streams of the <em>leukosmos</em> into the sea of peace that is the sage. But this is not so with the desirer of desires.
