      With the first year matched outright with the <a href = "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unix_time">first year here</a>, and telling the year thereafter by the year there, and unknowing the four unlucky days that end the hub&mdash; churn, churn, churn, churn, churn, churn, churn, churn. Today is <span id = "churn">today</span>.
      </p>
      <p>
      On the third day, the newt called V&aacute;ahq&aacute; understood altogether the ringing of the earth and the spinning of the sun and moon. And at a great gathering of every deer of everywhere, the glowing deer of the land were there, and the glowing deer of the sea were there, and so every deer was there, and no deer was not there. And the wisest newt spake, saying, Fellow deer, let us understand all together the ringing of the earth and the spinning of the sun and moon.

      Look, the month is told by the tide, and the tide is told by the year,<br />
      And the year is the twain of tide, and the year is given to the wisest twain of deer.<br />
      So the backboned deer fared from the sea, and also lived on land and by lift,<br />
      And the softshelled deer stayed in the sea, and also lived on land and in hell.<br />
      </p>
      <p class = "nowrap">
      Spinning and spinning, and spinning and spinning, and slowing down,<br />
      The year bears the great wain that shifts the deer by year.<br />
      Speeding speeding slowing down and spinning, and spinning, and slowing down,<br />
      The wain that stops is the wain that tips and falls, and breaks.<br />
      </p>
      <p class = "nowrap">
      The wain does not stop, the wain does not break.<br />
      The wain churns, and churns, and churns, and churns, and churns, and churns.<br />
      It churns the year, saying, &ldquo;Churn, churn, churn, churn, churn, churn,&rdquo;<br />
      It churns the year, saying, &ldquo;Churn, churn, churn, churn, churn, churn.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p class = "nowrap">
      And the wain is the twain of wheel, and the wheel is the four of spoke.<br />
      And the spoke is the twain of hub, and the hub is the four of year.<br />
      The year ends the year at the end of every year, and stirs the wain,<br />
      The wain is stirred in twain of tide, once before the midyear and once after.

      <p class = "nowrap">
      And the first tide is the sixth of month, and is had by every <em>hungry backbone</em>,<br />
      The eldest fish, the frog, the eft, the younger falk, the furt, the youngest fox,<br />
      And every <em>hungry backbone</em> but the eldest fish knows the land above,<br />
      And no <em>hungry backbone</em> but the eldest fish knows the hell below.
      </p>
      <p class = "nowrap">
      And the last tide is the sixth of month, and is had by every <em>hungry softshell</em>,<br />
      The eldest lurk, the jack, the elder crank, the ink, the lich, the youngest spark,<br />
      And every <em>hungry softshell</em> but the youngest spark knows the sea below,<br />
      And no <em>hungry softshell</em> but the youngest spark knows the lift above.
      </p>
      <p class = "nowrap">
      And the months <em>there</em> are told <em>there</em> by every outknelled ape <em>there</em>,<br />
      <em>Their</em> moon wends <em>their</em> earth, and wends <em>their</em> month, called,<br />
      After the new year, cake or rain, spring; and easter, bliss or milk, summer;<br />
      And litha or next after midsummer, grass, harvest; and winter, blood, yule.

      After she had said all of this, every deer beheld the ringing of the earth and the spinning of the sun and moon. And by the fourth day, every wyrm knew the ringing and the spinning, and knew them again. And by the twelfth day, when the month was half gone, every wyrm did not understand them, and in truth no wyrm understood them. For in those days, the sour and bitter berries did not grow much in the swamp, and so every deer lacked the red, yellow, lime, green berries.

      When the deer were hungry, then, this is what they ate. In those days, the deer did not know to make food with fire or ice, so they made their food lukewarm, and ate it lukewarm, and many did not like it. That is why many deer in those days did not eat at all, and did other things instead. The glowing deer of the land and the glowing deer of the sea ate apples, beans, beets, corns, cresses, fikes, mores, nuts, pears, plums. They also ate swampwort. The glowing deer of the land ate grasses, kales, leeks, rinds, roots, leaves, flowers, stems. The glowing deer of the sea ate ferns, mosses, reeds, sprouts, roots, leaves, flowers, stems. And so the wain shifted the deer, and no deer hungered.
