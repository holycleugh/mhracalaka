    <p class = "poem">
    The ring of liftly peers who journeyed to learn<br />
    The landed craft were soon deluded by hubris.<br />
    Envy and resentment storied of war,<br />
    Till violence joined two crowds of exiles in toil.

    <em>In the grove of the red woodpeckers.</em>

    <p class = "poem">
    Of the lifting <em>loop</em> of louds <em>cleft</em>, one came to learn<br />
    The lowerlandly laws, and then came to crave things, and clinged to them.<br />
    The bothwise bond between <em>broke</em>, and they became bitter,<br />
    And hatred <em>halved</em> them again, and soon <em>sixteen</em> soughs said things.
