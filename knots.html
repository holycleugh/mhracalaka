      A sakesome thinghouse of wonesome knots and links. <br />
      Of <strong>Louise Longleap</strong>, who fangled the first knot and forbound its lore; <br />
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;who slew the evil thurse of the evil eye; <br />
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;who begat the angry hound of the angry spear.
      </p>
      <p>
      Of the utter knots and links that bedwell this world, those unbemarksome by earthly knowledge grow more awful with each crossing. Notwithstandingly, three (3) kinds of motish havens from eight (8) kinds of motish knots are to be found: those of the leaf, the wend, and the twist.
      </p>
      <p>From here, everything follows.

      What does it mean to <em>lay</em> the knot?
      </p>
      <p class = "jka">
      To <em>lay</em> the knot is to lay it flat, <br />
      To open its arms to either side, <br />
      To beget four crossings two-by-two.
      </p>
      <p class = "cgi">
      What does it mean to <em>twist</em> the knot?
      </p>
      <p class = "jka">
      The loop, the clover, the glass, the fairy, <br />
      The thurse, the frog, the child, the bee;<br />
      These are the names of each of the twist knots, <br />
      <strong>And each is thus its twice-drawn lain.</strong>
      </p>
      <p class = "cgi">
      What does it mean to <em>wend</em> the knot?
      </p>
      <p class = "jka">
      To <em>wend</em> the knot is to twist a knob, <br />
      To wither its gaze around halfway, <br />
      To beget one crossing from itself.<br />
      </p>
      <p class = "cgi">
      How does it <em>look</em> to wend the knot?
      </p>
      <p class = "jka">
      The loop, the clover, the glass, the goose, the skirt; <br />
      These are the names of each of the went knots, <br />
      <strong>And each is thus its once-drawn went.</strong>
      </p>
      <p class = "cgi">
      What does it mean to <em>pluck</em> the knot?
      </p>
      <p class = "jka">
      The loop, the clover, the star, the blossom, the rose; <br />
      To pluck the knot is to see it in the mindseye, <br />
      And then clutch it! and these leaf knots bestand here now, <br />
      <strong>And each is thus its once-eked went.</strong>
      </p>
      <p class = "cgi">
      What utter knots linger, then?
      </p>
      <p class = "jka">
      <strong>Of six,</strong> the cradle; <br />
      <strong>Of seven,</strong> the twicethurse, the twicegoose; <br />
      <strong>Of eight,</strong> the thricethurse, the thricegoose, the cradled thurse, the moon; <br />
      <strong>Of nine,</strong> the twicechild, the thricefrog, the twiceskirt, the fourcegoose; <br />
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the goose-hooked thurse, the twofold goose-hooked goose.
      </p>
      <p class = "cgi">
      Now, I understand everything.
      </p>
      <p class = "jka">
      Bethink thee, knower of nothing but the meanest kinds. <br />
      For seven knots of seven are there, and but four beheld by thee; <br />
      And twenty-one knots of eight are there, and but six beheld by thee; <br />
      And thirty-six knots of nine are there, and but eight beheld by thee; <br />
      <br />
      And none thereafter.
