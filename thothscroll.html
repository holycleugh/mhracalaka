      <h3>How to conserve napkins.</h3>
      <br />
      <p>
      Within this page I claim that folding napkins along the diagonal, and not along the horizontal or vertical, permits generally the most economical use of napkins. I present such an algorithm and show its superiority to the rectangular algorithm. My plan is as follows: first, I introduce the assumptions and definitions to be used. I then present the traditional rectangular algorithm and my proposed triangular algorithm, giving a comparison in terms of the number of wipes, faces of napkin, and folds permitted by each. From this, I conclude that the triangular algorithm is superior.
      </p>
      <p>
      I assume the following. First, any spill has the shape of a perfect two-dimensional circle. Next, any $n$-stack of napkins (that is, a collection of $n$ napkins in as uniform of a stack as possible) is a perfect square in the plane. Consequently, a stack can be folded arbitrarily many times. I also assume that it is undesireable to have mattre come into contact with the skin at any point.
      </p>
      <p>
      Now, having established this, a few more restrictions on our triangular folding algorithm follow. I think we can all agree that due to the size and shape of the human hand and of a stack (henceforth and hitherto &ldquo;napkin&rdquo;, it is nigh impossible to wipe the spill with a given face of the napkin more than once without violating the no-contact principle, and so the number of faces used is always greater than or equal to the number of wipes. Similarly, it is impossible to wipe with one face, flip the napkin, and wipe with the opposite face. This is because doing so would require that the hand comes into contact with the mattre on the first face during the usage of the second face. As simple flipping is impermissible, it follows that each successful wipe must be followed by a fold. So the number of folds used is strictly greater than the number of wipes. I say strictly because any wiping algorithm requires each fold to be both preceded by and succeeded by a wipe. Otherwise, the napkin is either folded for no reason prior to application of any algorithm, or folded after the final wipe, again for no reason. By transitivity, the number of folds is also greater than the number of faces.
      </p>

      The rectangular algorithm of yore is quite simple. Given a napkin $T$ with side length $s$, the napkin is wiped with the centre of the spill aligned to the centre of the napkin, and then given a single fold parallel to its shorter side (if the napkin is square, a side is chosen at random). This procedure is iterated to satisfaction. The first wipe, using the entire napkin, permits an spill inscribed with radius $\frac{1}{2}s$, and so an area of $\frac{\pi}{4}s^2$. Indeed, every $2n - 1$ and $2n$th wipe for $n \in \N^0$ permits spills of radius $\frac{1}{2^{n + 1}}s$ and area $\frac{\pi}{2^{2n + 2}}s^2$. I enumerate the first several cases for the unit napkin of radius $1$.

      <table>
        <tr>
          <tr><th>Wipe number</th><th>1</th><th>2</th><th>3</th><th>4</th><!--<th>5</th>--><th>$\infty$</tr>
          <tr><th>Total area</th><td>$\frac{\pi}{4} \approx 0.785$</td><td>$\frac{5\pi}{16} \approx 0.982$</td><td>$\frac{3\pi}{8} \approx 1.178$</td><td>$\frac{25\pi}{64} \approx 1.227$</td><!--<td>$\frac{13\pi}{32} \approx 1.276$</td>--><td>$\frac{5\pi}{12} \approx 1.309$</td></tr>
      </table>
      <p>
      Let us now consider the triangular algorithm, first with $T_s$ (that is, the napkin of side length $s$). Again the first wipe requires no fold, and so permits $\frac{\pi}{4}s^2$ area. The second wipe permits an spill corresponding to the incircle of the isosceles right triangle of side length $s$. By theorem, this circle has radius $\frac{2 - \sqrt{2}}{2}s$ and area $\frac{(3 - 2\sqrt{2})\pi}{2}s^2$. Because each fold reduces the length of the side by $\sqrt{2}$, the $n$th wipe permits area $\frac{(3 - 2\sqrt{2})\pi}{2^{n - 1}}s^2$ for $n \gt 1$. I enumerate again the incipit sequence.
      </p>
      <table>
        <tr>
          <tr><th>Wipe number</th><th>1</th><th>2</th><th>3</th><th>4</th><!--<th>5</th>--><th>$\infty$</th></tr>
          <tr><th>Total area</th><td>$\frac{\pi}{4} \approx 0.785$</td><td>$\frac{(7 - 4\sqrt{2})\pi}{4} \approx 1.059$</td><td>$\frac{(5 - 3\sqrt{2})\pi}{2} \approx 1.190$</td><td>$\frac{(23 - 14\sqrt{2})\pi}{8} \approx 1.257$</td><!--<td>$\frac{(49 - 30\sqrt{2})\pi}{16} \approx 1.291$</td>--><td>$\frac{(13 - 8\sqrt{2})\pi}{4} \approx 1.324$</td></tr>
      </table>
      <p>
      It is plain to see that the triangular method is superior at every wipe, and strictly superior from the second wipe, in wiping the largest area with the fewest number of wipes and folds, and therefore the fewest napkins.
