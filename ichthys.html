      A solution to the problem of inequality. The meta-person creates to their specification manifestations of any choosing, and the person then manifests in an actual world. The only restriction upon the meta-person is invoking a meta-meta-person, which does not exist.
      </p>

      <p>
      Let $Q$ be the set of meta-persons $q$. For every $q$, the manifestation function $Mq$ gives a set of ordered pairs $\ang{p, w}$, each comprising a person $p \in P$ who manifests in a world $w \in W$. Every element of the sets $P$ and $W$ is detachable and intercroppable with respect to every $q \in Q$.
      </p>
      <p>
      Following Tarski, every element of $P$ and $W$ are of type 0, and may be denoted $P_0$ and $W_0$, respectively. Likewise, the set of meta-persons may be denoted $P_1$ instead of $Q$, and the set of meta-meta-persons either $P_2$ or $R$, and so on, and likewise with worlds without worlds $W = W_0$, $X = W_1$, $Y = W_2$, and so on. When dealing with entities of larger type, it is customary to use the Hebrew letters <span class = "hebrew">&#1508;</span> and <span class = "hebrew">&#1493;</span> to denote person-sets and world-sets, respectively. Nevertheless it is very rare that one must exceed entities of type 1.

      <strong>Example.</strong> Consider the meta-people January $q_1$ and February $q_2$. January is manifesting as the person Barack Obama $p_1$ in world $w_1$ and as a person $p_2$ in world $w_2$, while February is manifesting as a person Joe Biden $p_3$ in world $w_1$. Then because $p_1 \in w_1$ and $p_3 \in w_1$, January and February can interact as people in $w_1$ via Barack Obama and Joe Biden, and so January and February are co-occupied by $w_1$.
      </p>
      <p>
      Now, February desires to be Barack Obama in world $w_1$ as well. Then $w_1$ forks into $w_{1_a}$ and $w_{1_b}$ such that $\ang{p_1, w_{1_a}} \in Mq_1$ and $\ang{p_1, w_{1_b}} \in Mq_2$. And if January desires that $\imath p_1 (p_1 \in w_{1_a} = w_1)$ interact with $\imath p_1 (p_1 \in w_{1_b} = w_1)$, then these would cleave into $w_{1_{ab}}$, and so on. Observe that all of these persons and worlds are still of type 0.
      </p>

      There are crucial restrictions to the creation of persons and worlds. First, a world of level $n$ may be cleaved only from a world of level $m$ or higher, where $m \gt n$. This ensures that the universe is free of self-referential paradoxes that lead to contradictions. Another restriction is that every person of level $n$ is only aware of the existence of persons and worlds of level $m$ or lower, where $m \lt n$. This second restriction is often considered to be of paramount importance because it is what actually solves the problem of inequality &mdash; all other constructions hitherto have been modelled towards this objective. Indeed, any such ontological knowledge of a higher power creates troubling ethical and epistemic consequences (more to follow).
