      <strong>Hudhud:</strong> These are the verses of verses. Mirad, every verse is itself, and every verse is written as a word, as every word a verse.
      </p>
      <p>
      <strong>Hudhud:</strong> These are the words of words. Mirad, what is written here is found within the minds of the lonely hermits amidst these cliffs.
      </p>
      <p>
      <strong>Tawus:</strong> Aye, diamond-piercing Hudhud. I am ready to take flight.

      </p>
      <p>
      <strong>Hudhud:</strong> Hail, o cloud of fire! and let us go
      <br />To thee, that we may know the motions of
      <br />Thy tungly dance which carries to and fro
      <br />Those rhymes without sea, earth, and lift above.
      </p>
      <p>
      <strong>Andalib:</strong> These waves unshaping splash and spill adrift, 
      <br />These rays unruining render ev&rsquo;ry shade; 
      <br />These whorls ungrounding swirl around and shift; 
      <br />Arrive, and listen to the serenade.
      </p>
      <p>
      The tung uncome rests not in chasm or cave,
      <br />Nor flies beneath the seas plumage of noise,
      <br />Nor scales the summit of the loft concave 
      <br />Except she spreads her wings in mirrored poise.
      </p>
      <p>
      <strong>Hudhud:</strong> Now&mdash; speak, Tawus, divine! this tung is thine,
      <br />Thine to define! &rsquo;tis etched in nak&rsquo;d design.
      </p>
      <p style = "font-style: italic;">
      EXIT Hudhud.
      </p>
      <p>
      <strong>Tawus:</strong> Look, I feel the glyphs carved in my skull;
      <br />My claws do touch before their pull&mdash;
      </p>
      <p>
      Andalibs alcove dimly rests without 
      <br />The hav&rsquo;n of altered tung, where lurk outwise 
      <br />Eight thousand times eight thousand bees about 
      <br />And twenty twenty twenty butterflies.
      </p>
      <p>
      Nine hundred apians beyond this glome 
      <br />Confound and cloud, and swarm, and stab the mind; 
      <br />Twenty-one score more lepidopterans roam 
      <br />In subtle light, and contort every kind.
      </p>
      <p>
      Betwixt this mesh affix&egrave;d arcs unvexed 
      <br />The image of Ghurab twice-watching, bound 
      <br />With mortal skin; and Buma twice-unsexed,
      <br />In sideways stance half crowned and half uncrowned.
      </p>
      <p>
      <strong>Andalib:</strong> Saqr is she called; from eager springtime flight
      <br/>To regal yuletide swoop, she doth pursue 
      <br />A sacred twain of nests, alike not quite,
      <br />And numb&rsquo;ring two times two times two times two.
      </p>
      <p>
      See, with each nest an everlasting plane
      <br />Of eightfold gaze and never-passing quake;
      <br />And half, Qadus and Qadus bend their wain,
      <br />While half remain unstruck in their outtake;
      </p>
      <p>
      And half advance against that twain marquee,
      <br />While half withdraw to quieter plumage;
      <br />And half see &rsquo;neath their seat the rippling sea,
      <br />While half are plunged under its dark visage.<!-- the fixed tung manifests using whatever inventory is held by the beholder -->

      The final cut rends&mdash;

      <strong>Tawus:</strong> <span style = "float: right; margin-right: 40%;">And a light! it ends&mdash;</span>
      </p>
      <p>
      <strong>Andalib:</strong> And neither doth the traveller lose her way&mdash;

      <p>
      <strong>Tawus:</strong> Eight beacons gleam&mdash;

      And all of this did happen. And mirad, soon after, Tahwt began to walk this path<!--, saying &ldquo;Should Hades take me home again, know this: Serot&rsquo;nin was my vice, not bean nor bud-->.
