      <h3>In the orchard of the red woodpeckers.</h3>
      <p>
      <strong>Hudhud:</strong> These are the verses of verses. These words are clear to the ears of the anchorites who float about the cliffs, and who see and understand every current existence.
      </p>
      <p>
      <strong>Hudhud:</strong> Mirad, what is the nature of the beaks and the gizzards.
      </p>
      <p>
      <strong>Tawus:</strong> Truly, truly, these are <span class = "sullow">/p b f v m/</span>, and truly, these are <span class = "sullow">/t d &theta; &eth; n/</span>, and truly, these are <span class = "sullow">/c &#607; &#643; j &#626;/</span>, and truly, these are <span class = "sullow">/k g x &#611; &#331;/</span>.
      </p>
      <p>
      <strong>Andalib:</strong> But, but, wise Tawus, I understand not what you hat said. Teach me instead the dreg representation of the names, until comes the day when I am wise like you.
      </p>
      <p>
      <strong>Tawus:</strong> Truly, truly, the Thirty are upon thee smiling, for thou art wise. Mirad, these are &langle;<em>p b mh bh m</em>&rangle;, and these are &langle;<em>t d nh dh n</em>&rangle;, and these are &langle;<em>c j ch jh &ntilde;</em>&rangle;, and these are &langle;<em>k g &#7749;h gh &#7749;</em>&rangle;.
      </p>
      <p>
      <strong>Hudhud:</strong> And mirad, the Thirty were pleased, and they <em>did</em> upon Andalib smile, and they <em>did</em> upon Tawus smile. And because it <em>was</em> in that order, in truth, it was good.
      </p>
      <p>
      <strong>Saqr:</strong> What madness is this uproar, for mirad, I was sleeping. I am with great fury filled, and I shall this hallowfool destroy. The worms were with their eyes shut begotten, and they shall with their eyes shut remain.
      </p>
      <p>
      <strong>Hudhud:</strong> Upon hearing this, wise Tawus fell not to the seduction of sigrious Saqr. Mirad, what is the nature of the more perfect beaks and the more perfect gizzards.
      </p>
      <p>
      <strong>Tawus:</strong> Truly, truly, the middle ones are <span class = "sullow">/l &#654; &#671; &#620; &#622; &#634;/</span>, and mirad, these were given as &langle;<em>l y r lh yh rh</em>&rangle;, which they still <em>are</em>, and truly, truly, the prodigal ones are <span class = "sullow">/a i u aa ii uu/</span>, and mirad, these were given as &langle;<em>a i u &amacr; &imacr; &umacr;</em>&rangle;, which they still <em>are</em>.
      </p>
      <p>
      <strong>Saqr:</strong> Thou hast with thine foolishness the worms to the surface led, and now in great patience shall the worms with naught to their name cease to breathe.
      </p>
      <p>
      <strong>Andalib:</strong> Silence, sigrious Saqr.
      </p>
      <p>
      <strong>Hudhud:</strong> Having said this, mirad, young Andalib was with mortal terror engulfed. And he <em>did</em> begin to weep.
      </p>
      <p>
      <strong>Saqr:</strong> Mirad, mirad, thou hast thine nest built, but thou art not swift Samama, and the worms shall upon thine body begin to feast.
      </p>
      <p>
      <strong>Andalib:</strong> How my heart is heavy with dread. Thirty times was I from the neptunian waters crafted, but nine hundred times shall I into the plutonic fires be cast.
      </p>
      <p>
      <strong>Hudhud:</strong> Mirad, a song of praise.
      </p>
      <p>
      <strong>Hudhud:</strong> The lifting.
      </p>
      <p>
      <strong>Hudhud:</strong> The elephant, and the vulture, and the whale.
      </p>
      <p>
      <strong>Hudhud:</strong> The path of the sun is in the light of the moon bathed, for she is his teacher. And as the sun turns in rings incalculable, the moon <em>does</em> in all directions continue to guide its path.
      </p>
      <p>
      <strong>Hudhud:</strong> Iteru and torchwood and saguaro and llareta and watiya. They thrive where others have languished.
      </p>
      <p>
      <strong>Tawus:</strong> I shall the recitation begin, and thou shall not stop me, sigrious Saqr. And young Andalib shall therefore once again be given life.

      <strong>Andalib:</strong> But, but, wise Tawus, these are idle and unchaste.
      </p>
      <p>
      <strong>Saqr:</strong> Mirad, wise Tawus, these <em>are</em> in truth idle and unchaste, and the Thirty shall with thine craft be displeased. I am by thine folly filled with mirth.
      </p>
      <p>
      <strong>Tahwt:</strong> Thrice of all the hues in the world, and then thrice of a queens mansion, and then twice of a metals pound, and then twice of all the corners of the world.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Tawus:</strong> In truth, yea and nay, these stand against each other, and so mirad, their names are <em>yhi</em> and <em>ra</em>. And in truth, cometh and drapeth and mathel, these stand against each other, and so mirad, their names are <em>lu</em> and <em>yhu</em> and <em>la</em>, and bringeth, it watches over them, and so mirad, its name is <em>ri</em>. And in truth, everything and something, these stand against each other, and so mirad, their names are <em>ya</em> and <em>lhu</em>. And in truth, when we naysay or when we ettle, these stand against each other, and so mirad, their names are <em>lha</em> and <em>rha</em>.
      </p>
      <p>
      <strong>Hudhud:</strong> When wise Tawus had this recitation fulfilled, mirad, sigrious Saqr was terrified.
      </p>
      <p>
      <strong>Tahwt:</strong> And one, mirad, <em>yha bhu rha yha dhu rha bhu ruru.</em>
      </p>
      <p>
      <strong>Tahwt:</strong> And two, mirad, <em>yhayha bhu rha yha dhu rha bhu ruru rha yhayha bhu rha dhu ru rha yha bhu rha jhu rururu.</em>
      </p>
      <p>
      <strong>Tahwt:</strong> And three, mirad, <em>yhayha lhabhu rha lhadhu ru rha yha dhu rha bhu ruru.</em>
      </p>
      <p>
      <strong>Hudhud:</strong> Mirad, mirad, I am before the awful glory that beacons from that reckoned wend, for in truth, I <em>did</em> the lifting of all numbers beckon, when I had not yet begotten the second generation.
      </p>
      <p>
      <strong>Tahwt:</strong> Dost thou know not the power that I yet lack to accomplish this task. Accomplish your lifting <em>now</em>, and in truth, thou shalt with me in the place where <em>li</em> dwells reckon.
      </p>
      <p>
      <strong>Tahwt:</strong> And nevertheless I say unto thee, <em>yhayha li bhu lu dhu rha yha lhu jhu ruyhayha li bhu lu dhu ruyuyha li bhu lu yha jhu rha dhu rururu rha yha li lu yha bhu rha yha jhu rha dhu rururu rha yha li lu yha bhu rha dhu rururu</em>.
      </p>
      <p>
      <strong>Hudhud:</strong> And mirad, it <em>was</em> accomplished.
      </p>
      <p>
      <strong>Saqr:</strong> O blessed sigour. Now I understand all things that are within my grasp, and now I understand that in truth, I do not understand all things that are unending, for everything is unending.
      </p>
      <p>
      <strong>Tawus:</strong> Amen, in truth, the boding has been fulfilled.
      </p>
      <p>
      <strong>Andalib:</strong> Amen.
      </p>
      <p>
      <strong>Hudhud:</strong> And mirad, it was so, and the Thirty <em>did</em> see it, and the Thirty <em>did</em> become made glad.
