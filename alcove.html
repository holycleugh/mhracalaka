      <br />Thy tungly dance which carries to and fro
      <br />Those rhymes without sea, earth, and lift above.

      <strong>Andalib:</strong> These waves unshaping splash and spill adrift,

      <br />Outwise our sunstruck sphere in silence, unneeding of torchwick.
      <br />Stealth&egrave;d by eight thousand eight thousand bees and a score score score butterflies,
      <br />She, with her swarms of daggers unscatt&rsquo;rable, returns us aphasic.

      <br />Sunder a chasm thiswise and nextwise through smothering densities:
      <br />Twenty-one score lepidopterans and nine hundred apians rise,
      <br />Numbering few but thund&rsquo;ring with fury, they shower manipoeic
      <br />Nectar undoing against the wanderer, her selfness to disguise,
      <br />Betwixt these twin meshes affix&egrave;d who answers the call of the liminic.

      Nine hundred apians beyond this glome
      <br />Confound and cloud, and swarm, and stab the mind;

      <br />In subtle light, and contort every kind.
