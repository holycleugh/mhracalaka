      <strong>Worldfaring</strong> is the deed of faring between worlds. There are two kinds of worldfaring: <strong>withfaring</strong>, or faring between worlds of the same rank; and <strong>underfaring</strong>, or faring into worlds of lower rank. Withfaring is slow, careful, and shortlived; it needs much inlooking and a known reachsome world. Underfaring is less so, and happens anywhere and everywhere, at once and forever. Worldfaring has wise and witty brooks rimelore and wisdom, namely in thinklore, beinglore, and rightlore.

      <h2 id = "maps">Two maps.</h2>
      <p>
      The two maps for worldfaring are given.
      </p>
      <h3 id = "under">The underfaring map.</h3>
      <p class = "bemark">
      The <strong>underfare</strong> is the onemapping $U : P^{r+1} \hookrightarrow 2^{P^r \times W^r}$ given by $p^{r+1} \mapsto \{(p_i^r, w_i^r)\}$.
      </p>
      <p class = "foreset">
      If $p \in w$, then unendingly many souls $q$ and worlds $v$ gladden the sameshift $(p, w) \cong (q, v)$.
      </p>
      <p>
      Look, the underfare maps the soul of rank $r+1$ to a many, perhaps unending, of soul-world twains of rank $r$. The soul $p_i^r$ has free standing in its world $w_i^r$, and neither knows nor understands the foresoul $p^{r+1}$ from which it is mapped. On the other hand, the foresoul $p^{r+1}$ is and knows all of its underfared souls $p_i^r$, and shifts their thoughts and deeds outright.
      </p>
      <p>
      The sameshift between worlds $w$ and $v$ keeps all standings and suchnesses, such that they seem outright the same in every way and from every rank. So, $w$ and $v$ are both the same and not the same.
      </p>
      <h3 id = "over">The withfaring map.</h3>
      <p class = "bemark">
      The <strong>beam</strong> is the flipmap $B : P \times W \to P \times W$ given by $(p, w) \mapsto (p, \bar w)$.

      </p>
      <p>
      The withfare is much less understood than the underfare. While the underfare maps one soul of any world into a many of soul-world twains of lesser rank, the withfare maps one soul-world twain into another soul-world twain. Because the withfare maps between <em>lockings</em> of worlds, and not the worlds themselves, it must be bookended by a beam and a flipbeam. Furthermore, in order to undertake a withfare, the aftermapped world must already be reachsome. The reachsomeness of a world is given by the reaching suchness of the worldfarer as follows; to come to know such a world is to <strong>worldfind</strong>.

        <li><strong>Everbonding ($\omega$).</strong> Some world is reachsome.</li>
        <li><strong>Selfbonding ($\rho$).</strong> This world is reachsome.</li>

        <li><strong>Overshifting ($\tau$).</strong> Every world that is reached by some reachsome world, is reachsome.</li>

      <h2 id = "brooks">A brook.</h2>
      <p>
      Shown here is a brook for worldfaring, a rightlorely answer to unevenness in fellowship by means of worldfinding.<!--, and the next brook is a twofold path to wend being itself.-->
      </p>
      <h3 id = "rightlore">The rightlorely brook.</h3>
      <p>
      Among the many worries of the world is the worry of unevenness in fellowship; that is, the worry that souls, from birth until death, are dealt uneven and unsame standings in wealth, strength, and smarth, and often bequeath their standing to their offspring, begetting an awful and uneven fellowship, filled with sorrow. However, the worldfarer overcomes this worry by finding a new and alike world of lesser rank, and bringing everything with suchness from their world into it.
      </p>
      <p>
      As byshow, let $w$ be a world, and let $p, q \in w$ be souls in $w$. Deem $p$ to be unhappy with their own standing in $w$; then $p$ finds a world $v$ of lesser rank, and underfares into it as another soul, say $p'$. Then, the map $U : p \mapsto (p', v)$ gives $p$ a world in which to be happy, such that $w$ and $v$ are alike in some ways. Look, the likeness of $w$ and $v$ is set by the <em>understanding</em> that $p$ has of $w$. The better $p$ understands $w$, the better $p$ finds and wends $v$.
      </p>
      <p>
      Now, if $q$ comes to hear of this, and becomes nithy, then $q$ finds a world $u$ of lesser rank and underfares into <em>it</em> by the underfare $U : q \mapsto (q', u)$. Here, if $q$ understands $w$ enoughly well, then the found world $u$ can be made to sameshift with $v$; that is, $u \cong v$. Then, things are as such. $p$ and $q$, who are both unhappy in $w$ in some way, fare as $p' \in v$ and $q' \in u$. Because $u \cong v$, everything that $p'$ does in $v$ is felt in $u$, and everything that $q'$ does in $u$ is felt in $v$. Furthermore, if either $p$ or $q$ has great enough understanding, then the two souls $p'$ and $q'$ can be made to sameshift, such that $(p', v) \cong (q', u)$. What follows is that $p$ and $q$ are neither alike in suchness or standing nor not alike in suchness or standing, because the twain $(p', v)$ both is and is not the same as the twain $(q', u)$. Hence, $p$ and $q$ are even in every way in the lesser rank.
