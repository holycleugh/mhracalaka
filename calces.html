      Godlike Achilles, his shade like the blood of Deiphobus pale-shielded,<br />
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gleefully chasing past hill and dale, facing his ultimate dues before<br />
      Godlike Achilles, fell weak and broken, and with chariot destroyed and spear<br />
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Broken. See, o grey Priam, come kneeling &rsquo;fore thrice-equal Hecate,<br />
      Dinning with Hector, like sky and dark sea, as the counterpoint rhythm of<br />
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Daybreaks opaquest white misty clear and midnights moonlit-black billow waves<br />
      Marks it our equal in gustaties.<br style = "line-height: 24pt;" />

        <del><em>But lifting his voice he called aloud on De&iuml;phobos of the pale shield, and asked him for a long spear, but De&iuml;phobos was not near him. And Hektor knew the truth inside his heart, and spoke aloud: &ldquo;No use. Here at last the gods have summoned me deathward. I thought De&iuml;phobos the hero was here close beside me, but he is behind the wall and it was Athene cheating me.&rdquo;</em></del>

        <em><span style = "font-variant: small-caps;">Then</span> he shouted aloud, and called to Deiphobus of the white shield, and asked of him a long spear; but he was nowise nigh. And Hector knew all in his heart, and spake, saying: &ldquo;Out upon it, in good sooth have the gods called me to my death. For I deemed that the warrior Deiphobus was at hand, but lo, he is within the wall, and Athene hath beguiled me.&rdquo;</em>
