      <h3>How the turntables of Achilles have.</h3>
      <br />
      <p>
      Godlike Achilles, his heart gripped with terror as glorious Hector was,<br />
      Riding through hill and dale &rsquo;gainst his ascending fate reckoned by Peleus son,<br />
      Godlike Achilles, did cower now, ugly in visage and broken in <br />
      Stature. So we, with bold Priam, do kneel before thrice-equal Hecate,<br />
      Dining with Hector, with sky in sea, watching the starkest of contrasts from <br />
      Daybreaks opaquest white ocean clear to midnights moonlit-black billow waves<br />
      Mark it our equal in likenesses.<br />
      <br />
